# Here we collect known posible issues at making .chsheet files
The problems will be grouped by key, if you are creating a .chseet file and some field isn't showing, or all the sheet, you can take a look of this file in case other person had the same issue and corrected.

## img key
By default, images are stored on '"/images/"', if you want to add an image to your '.chsheet', be sure you arenÂ´t adding an extra '/' to the path.
```json
"img": "img4.png",
```
If the image is inside a directory:
```json
"img": "path/to/image/img4.png",
```
In both cases the key must not start with '/'

## form key (LaTeX)
### General function working
To make LaTeX work inside a json file, you should replace '\' for '\\' in your form
The next Example works in LaTeX editors but not on Open Cheatsheet

```latex
S = a \cdot h 
```
To make it work, just add a double '\'
```json
"forms": "S = a \\cdot"
```
### Multiline forms
Unfortunelly each form must be in one line, if you have more than one, add one "forms" for each one. This is because LaTeX is inside a JSON and because of the library used, if you create a 1-line form with multiline (like using '\\' , '\n', '\;', etc) it wint work properly.

## Not sure where is the problem
### Are you using tables?
If you are **not using** one or both tables, check the key, if present it must be deleted:

This line may cause error
```json
 "var_table": [],
```

The same way, the cons table may look like this and been causin problems.

```json
 "cons_table": {
        "headers": [
            "Constant",
            "Value",
            "Description"
        ],
        "rows": []
   },
```
In both cases, all key-block should be erased.

# Detail key (Markddown language)
If you want to add multiple lines in the "detail" field, you just need to add **two spaces** followed by **'\n'**

```json
{
  "example": "This is first line.  \nAnd this is second line."
}
```
