# Contributing to the Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We are working hard to create a 100% open-source and non-profit platform aimed at delivering valuable resources for students and educators. As we continue to develop the platform, we are seeking help from contributors in various areas.

## Funding Support

We are approaching the stage where we will begin accepting donations to help cover the costs of running and maintaining our servers. These funds will be used solely to ensure the platform remains free and accessible to everyone.

## Areas Where You Can Help

We are looking for passionate individuals who can contribute in the following areas:

- **Content Creation (Formulas and Explanations):** Help us compile and refine the academic content, such as formulas and problem-solving explanations, for various subjects.
  
- **Testers:** Assist with testing the app across different platforms to identify and resolve any bugs or issues.

- **Designers:** We need creative designers to improve the visual aspects of the platform, including UI/UX design and graphics.

- **Translators:** Help us make the platform accessible to a global audience by translating the content into different languages.

- **Idea and Design Suggestions:** Even if you cannot contribute directly, we welcome any suggestions or ideas that could help improve the project as we move forward in development.

## 100% Open and Non-Profit

This project is completely free and open-source. All contributions, big or small, are highly valued, and the project will always remain non-profit, focused solely on providing a free and accessible resource for everyone.
