## What is a .chsheet file?

Open CheatSheet uses files with the `.chsheet` extension to store formulas, constants, and explanations in a structured format. Hereâ€™s what a typical file contains:

- **Title**: The name of the formula or concept.
- **Brief Description**: A short description summarizing the concept.
- **Detailed Explanation**: A more detailed, multi-paragraph explanation with support for lists and LaTeX-like formatting for formulas.
- **Formula(s)**: The primary formula written in LaTeX syntax.
- **Variables Table**: A table explaining the variables used in the formula.
- **Constants Table**: A table of constants with their values and descriptions.
- **Images**: An optional image related to the concept (e.g., diagrams, charts, etc.).
- **References**: Links to websites that provide more in-depth information on the topic.
- **Related Formulas**: Links to other related `.chsheet` files.
